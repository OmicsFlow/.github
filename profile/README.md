# OmicsFlow
> The `OmicsFlow` organization is developed and maintained by a doctor from the School of Oceans and Earth, `Xiamen University`. It is mainly committed to the development of `bioinformatics` omics `analysis workflow`, omics analysis `desktop program`, and omics analysis `cloud platform`. At present, the construction of `genomics` analysis workflow and the development of analysis desktop are the primary tasks, and then the development and construction of `transcriptomics`, `proteomics`, `metabonomics` and `single cell` analysis platforms will be carried out successively.
